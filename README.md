GatewayD plugin template in Python

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was an attempt to create a plugin (template) for GatewayD in Python to show how one can write a plugin in another language (than Go). This does not work as is, and needs a few or _maybe_ a lot of modifications. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK! There are no plans to continue the development of plugin templates in Go or any other language, because GatewayD creates the Go plugin scaffold itself from [v0.9.5](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/gatewayd/releases/tag/v0.9.5) on.
